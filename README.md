# IXL-Helper
Ever struggle with IXLs? or just don't feel like doing them?
Then this is the tool for you. It highlights the correct response for the user to make it easy to correctly respond and even make a good grade. 
This is open source for anyone who wants to contribute and help!
This is my first Chrome extension and project in this sense 
and i'm mainly doing it to see what I can make using what I know but I also know this is a tool that will be helpful to people including me so feel free to fix or make it better in any way possible, and share it cause we can all agree ixl is bull shit. 

## What is Expected To Come with this
Early on this will probably only do a small number of levels/grades but I hope to grow it over time
Language Arts is the first stage but math and other subjects will come later on in development

## What used in this 
Python, JavaScript, HTML, Transformers (py library), Torch (py library)

## File Path (what it should look like) 
### You might have to view this inside the readme.md file itself to view it
